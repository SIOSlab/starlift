1. Make prop block more robust and able to accept different architectures (e.g. separate Hall, Ion, etc. thrusters). May require more in-depth thruster modelling and deeper knowledge on predictions
2. Integrate orbits block, to be replaced by Savransky group
3. Accept libraries of different architectures
